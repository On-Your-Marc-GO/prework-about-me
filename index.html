      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello! If you're reading this, thanks for taking the time to do so. I'm Marc and I'm an aspiring
        software developer. 
      </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Originally, I'm from Corpus Christ, TX</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Distance running, PC Gaming (when time allows), journaling, attending live concerts, and music.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>In a perfect world, I'd either be a professional streamer or gamer. Realistically because I'm not
        nearly interesting or good enough to be either, I'd love to be competent and respected software dev
        working to create tools of use.
      </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Currently I reside in Houston, TX.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I believe in todays world of IoT and interconnectedness through the web, this type of skillset and 
        general know-how is wonderful, and realistically mandatory, skill set to have. Taking into a career 
        only seems like a logical step.
